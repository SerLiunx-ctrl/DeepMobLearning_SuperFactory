# Deep Mob Learning
A server friendly mod for mob loot acquisition. It's inspired by the Soul shards mod where you could "collect" mob kills to later
reuse them for mob spawners.

This mod however uses "Data models" that you train by defeating monsters both by hand or by
simulation(In the simulation chamber). To get started you will need a Deep Learner, which will house the data models, and
some type of mob data model.

Once your data models have reached higher tiers you can use them in the simulation chamber to get loot.
